# Next Session: Integration Tests for Refactored PuzzleViewModel

## Context
Phase 2.1 of the PuzzleViewModel refactoring is 95% complete:
- Successfully refactored from 1036 to 436 lines (58% reduction)
- Created 6 focused manager classes with single responsibilities
- Written 92 unit tests (63 passing, 14 failing)
- Fixed critical bugs with objectWillChange forwarding for UI updates

## Current Status
- Unit tests: 77 executing (63 passing, 14 failing)
- Core functionality is working in simulator
- Some edge cases need attention based on failing unit tests

## What Needs To Be Done

### 1. Fix Remaining Unit Test Failures (Priority: High)
Before writing integration tests, fix the 14 failing unit tests:
- GameStateManagerTests: 4 failures (progress calculation, puzzle initialization, reset, animation)
- InputHandlerTests: 3 failures (delete behavior, invalid character, symbol cell selection)
- HintManagerTests: 3 failures (revealed cell handling, invalid index, symbol cell reveal)
- PuzzleProgressManagerTests: 1 failure (completion time calculation)
- StatisticsManagerTests: 3 failures (average time calculations)

### 2. Write Integration Tests (Priority: High)
Create PuzzleViewModelIntegrationTests.swift to test coordination between managers:

**Critical User Workflows to Test:**
1. Complete puzzle flow (start → input letters → complete → save progress)
2. Daily puzzle flow (load daily → complete → mark as completed)
3. Hint system flow (request hint → reveal letter → update UI → affect statistics)
4. Error/retry flow (make mistakes → game over → retry)
5. Pause/resume flow (pause → timer stops → resume → timer continues)
6. Settings change flow (change encoding type → puzzle updates → progress saves)

**Key Integration Points to Test:**
- GameStateManager ↔ InputHandler coordination
- GameStateManager ↔ HintManager coordination
- PuzzleViewModel ↔ All managers state synchronization
- Progress saving across managers
- Error propagation and recovery

### 3. Performance Testing (Priority: Medium)
- Test puzzle loading performance with large quotes
- Test UI responsiveness during rapid input
- Memory usage during extended play sessions

### 4. Update Documentation (Priority: Low)
- Update TECHNICAL_DEBT_ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 2.1 as complete
- Document the new architecture for future developers
- Add inline documentation to manager classes

## Technical Notes
- All managers are in `simple cryptogram/ViewModels/` subdirectories
- Test files are in `simple cryptogramTests/`
- Use XCTest framework with async/await patterns
- Mock DatabaseService for integration tests to avoid side effects

## Success Criteria
- All 92 unit tests passing
- 15-20 comprehensive integration tests covering critical workflows
- No regression in app functionality
- Performance metrics documented

## Next Steps After This Session
- Phase 2.2: Consolidate State Management
- Phase 2.3: Refactor NavigationBarView
- Phase 3: Performance & Testing improvements
