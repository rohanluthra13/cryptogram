# Continue Phase 2.1 - Unit Tests for PuzzleViewModel Refactoring

## Context
I've successfully completed Phase 2.1 of the Technical Debt Roadmap, refactoring PuzzleViewModel from 1036 lines down to 436 lines (58% reduction) by extracting functionality into 6 focused manager classes. The refactoring is complete and builds successfully.

## Current Status
- âœ… PuzzleViewModel refactoring complete (436 lines, clean architecture)
- âœ… 6 manager classes created with single responsibilities
- âœ… Full backward compatibility maintained
- âœ… 92 unit tests written for all managers
- ðŸ”§ Minor compilation errors in tests need fixing

## What Needs To Be Done

### 1. Fix Remaining Test Compilation Errors
The test suite is 95% complete but has a few minor compilation errors:

**PuzzleProgressManagerTests.swift:**
- Line 258-274: DatabaseError enum throws need string parameters
- Example: Change `throw DatabaseError.queryFailed` to `throw DatabaseError.queryFailed("Test error")`

### 2. Run and Verify All Tests Pass
Once compilation is fixed:
- Run the full test suite 
- Verify all 92 tests pass
- Fix any failing tests

### 3. Consider Integration Tests (Optional)
After unit tests pass, optionally add:
- PuzzleViewModel coordination tests
- Critical user workflow tests (complete puzzle, daily puzzle, hints)

## Test File Locations
```
simple cryptogramTests/
â”œâ”€â”€ GameStateManagerTests.swift (19 tests) âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ InputHandlerTests.swift (15 tests) âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ HintManagerTests.swift (13 tests) âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ PuzzleProgressManagerTests.swift (12 tests) - needs fixes
â”œâ”€â”€ StatisticsManagerTests.swift (20 tests) âœ…
â””â”€â”€ DailyPuzzleManagerTests.swift (13 tests) âœ…
```

## Specific Fix Needed
In PuzzleProgressManagerTests.swift, the ErrorStore class needs updating:
- All DatabaseError throws need parameters
- The enum cases that need parameters are:
  - `.queryFailed(String)`
  - `.dataCorrupted(String)`
  - `.initializationFailed(String)`
  - `.invalidData(String)`

## Next Steps After Tests
Once tests are passing:
1. Update TECHNICAL_DEBT_ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 2.1 as fully complete
2. Proceed to Phase 2.2: Consolidate State Management
3. Or continue with Phase 2.3: Refactor NavigationBarView

## Notes
- The 436-line PuzzleViewModel is acceptable (no need to reduce further)
- The architecture is clean and maintainable
- 92 tests provide excellent coverage for future refactoring confidence
