Cryptogram App Issues - Root Causes
1. Inconsistent Cell Modification
Cause 1: In PuzzleViewModel.swift, the inputLetter() method originally applied inputs to all matching cells, but we've modified it to only affect one cell.
Cause 2: The cryptogram paradigm requires consistent letter substitution, but the model doesn't enforce this constraint.
Cause 3: handleDelete() and revealCell() still operate on all cells with matching encoded characters.
2. Encoding and Solution Alignment Issues
Cause 1: In Puzzle.swift, the createLetterEncodedCells() and createNumberEncodedCells() methods don't properly align the encoded text with the solution text.
Cause 2: The methods attempt to match characters 1:1 without considering symbols and whitespace.
Cause 3: The DatabaseService.swift might provide encoded text and solutions that aren't properly aligned.
3. Error Marking for Correct Letters
Cause 1: In PuzzleViewModel.swift, when inputting a letter, cells are marked with isError = !isCorrect && !uppercaseLetter.isEmpty, but there might be an issue with how isCorrect is evaluated.
Cause 2: In CryptogramCell.swift, the isCorrect property originally used userInput == String(solutionChar ?? " "), which could lead to incorrect results if solutionChar is nil.
Cause 3: The UI in PuzzleCell.swift uses borderColor that depends on both isSelected and isError, potentially creating visual confusion.
4. Game Not Ending After 3 Mistakes
Cause 1: In PuzzleViewModel.swift, there's no code to check if mistakeCount has reached its maximum and end the game.
Cause 2: The checkPuzzleCompletion() method only checks for puzzle completion by correctness, not failure by mistake count.
5. Empty Hints
Cause 1: In Puzzle.swift, solution characters might be nil if there's a mismatch between encoded text and solution.
Cause 2: The revealCell() method in PuzzleViewModel.swift doesn't properly handle cells with nil solution characters.
6. Inconsistent Behavior Between Actions
Cause 1: Each action (inputLetter(), handleDelete(), revealCell()) has different implementations for handling which cells to modify.
Cause 2: No central logic to determine whether operations should apply to single cells or all matching cells.
7. Database Synchronization Issues
Cause 1: In DatabaseService.swift, encoded quotes might not match their solutions in length or structure.
Cause 2: The fetchRandomPuzzle() and fetchPuzzleById() methods don't verify alignment between encoded text and solution.
8. IsCorrect Logic
Cause 1: In CryptogramCell.swift, the isCorrect property doesn't handle nil solution characters properly.
Cause 2: The null coalescing with a space (solutionChar ?? " ") could lead to false positives or negatives.
9. User Experience Inconsistency
Cause 1: In PuzzleCell.swift, the borderColor is determined by multiple factors including isSelected and isError.
Cause 2: In PuzzleViewModel.swift, error states are set incorrectly, which then affects the visual display.
Cause 3: The UI doesn't clearly distinguish between "incorrect" and "not verified yet" states.
