# Technical Debt Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap addresses critical and high-priority technical debt in the Simple Cryptogram codebase. The work is organized into phases to ensure stability while improving code quality.

## Phase 1: Critical Stability Issues (1-2 days)

### 1.1 Fix Memory Leaks in PuzzleViewModel ✅
**File**: `ViewModels/PuzzleViewModel.swift`
**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-01-24)
**Tasks**:
- [x] Add `deinit` method to remove all NotificationCenter observers
- [x] Review all closures and add `[weak self]` where needed
- [x] Test with Instruments to verify no retain cycles

**Changes Made**:
- Added `deinit` method that calls `NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(self)`
- Fixed all DispatchQueue.async closures to use `[weak self]`
- Fixed Task closure in `loadAuthorIfNeeded` to use `[weak self]`
- Verified all DispatchQueue.asyncAfter closures already had proper weak references

### 1.2 Remove Force Unwrapping in LocalPuzzleProgressStore ✅
**File**: `Services/LocalPuzzleProgressStore.swift`
**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-01-24)
**Tasks**:
- [x] Replace force unwraps on lines 88, 89, 121-122 with safe unwrapping
- [x] Add fallback UUID generation for corrupted data
- [ ] Add unit tests for edge cases

**Changes Made**:
- Added `generateFallbackUUID(for:)` helper function that creates deterministic UUIDs from corrupted strings
- Replaced all force unwraps in `attempts(for:encodingType:)` method with safe unwrapping
- Replaced all force unwraps in `allAttempts()` method with safe unwrapping
- Added error logging when corrupted records are skipped
- Verified project builds successfully

### 1.3 Implement Proper Error Handling ✅
**Files**: `Services/DatabaseService.swift`, `Services/LocalPuzzleProgressStore.swift`
**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-01-24)
**Tasks**:
- [x] Create `DatabaseError` enum with user-friendly messages
- [x] Replace print statements with proper error propagation
- [x] Add error handling UI in ContentView
- [x] Create error recovery strategies for common failures

**Changes Made**:
- Created `DatabaseError` enum with user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions
- Updated `DatabaseService` methods to throw errors instead of printing/returning nil
- Updated `LocalPuzzleProgressStore` methods to throw errors with proper error propagation
- Updated `PuzzleProgressStore` protocol to reflect throwing methods
- Added `currentError` property to `PuzzleViewModel` with automatic recovery attempts
- Updated all database/progress store calls in `PuzzleViewModel` to handle errors
- Enhanced `ContentView` with error alerts showing recovery actions
- Created `ErrorRecoveryService` for automatic error recovery strategies
- Verified successful build with all error handling in place

## Phase 2: Architecture Refactoring (3-4 days)

### 2.1 Break Up PuzzleViewModel ✅
**Original**: 1036 lines of mixed responsibilities
**Current**: 436 lines (58% reduction) - COMPLETED 2025-01-25
**Implemented Structure**:
```
ViewModels/
├── PuzzleViewModel.swift (coordinator, 436 lines)
├── GameState/
│   └── GameStateManager.swift (200 lines)
├── Progress/
│   ├── PuzzleProgressManager.swift (103 lines)
│   └── StatisticsManager.swift (60 lines)
├── Input/
│   ├── InputHandler.swift (140 lines)
│   └── HintManager.swift (65 lines)
└── Daily/
    └── DailyPuzzleManager.swift (130 lines)
```

**Tasks**:
- [x] Extract game state logic to GameStateManager
- [x] Move progress tracking to PuzzleProgressManager
- [x] Create InputHandler for keyboard/selection logic
- [x] Extract hint logic to HintManager
- [x] Create StatisticsManager for stats calculations
- [x] Create DailyPuzzleManager for daily puzzle features
- [x] Update PuzzleViewModel to coordinate between managers
- [x] Maintain full backward compatibility
- [x] Build succeeds with no compilation errors
- [x] Assess further reduction opportunities - DECISION: 436 lines is acceptable given complexity
- [x] Add unit tests for each new component ✅ COMPLETE (92 unit tests, all passing)
- [x] Fix all failing unit tests ✅ COMPLETE (2025-01-25)
- [x] Add comprehensive integration tests ✅ COMPLETE (14 integration tests)

- Total: 106 tests (92 unit + 14 integration/performance tests)

**Critical Bug Fixes Applied** (2025-01-24):
1. Fixed cell selection and input issues by adding objectWillChange forwarding from GameStateManager to PuzzleViewModel
2. Fixed overlay display issues (pause, game over, info) by ensuring proper state observation
3. Added objectWillChange forwarding from DailyPuzzleManager for daily puzzle UI updates

**Test Fixes Applied** (2025-01-25):
1. **GameStateManagerTests**: Fixed progressPercentage calculation, added hasStarted property, fixed resetPuzzle to reset hasUserEngaged
2. **InputHandlerTests**: Added input validation for single letters only, fixed symbol cell selection logic, improved delete handling
3. **HintManagerTests**: Enhanced validation for already revealed cells, invalid indices, and symbol cells
4. **PuzzleProgressManagerTests**: Fixed completion time to use session.endTime instead of current date
5. **StatisticsManagerTests**: Fixed test helper to properly handle completion times for failed attempts

**Integration Tests Added**:
- Complete puzzle workflow (start → input → complete → save)
- Daily puzzle workflow (load → complete → persistence)
- Hint system workflow (reveal → UI update → statistics)
- Error/retry workflow (mistakes → game over → retry)
- Pause/resume workflow (pause → timer stops → resume)

- [ ] 80% overall test coverage
- [ ] All critical paths tested

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Feature Freeze**: No new features during refactoring
2. **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable commits
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain all existing functionality
4. **User Testing**: Beta test after each phase

## Post-Refactoring Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easier to add new features
2. **Reliability**: Fewer crashes and bugs
3. **Performance**: Better experience on older devices
4. **Testability**: Confidence in future changes
5. **Developer Experience**: Cleaner, more intuitive codebase

## Notes

- Each task should be a separate commit
- Run full test suite after each phase
- Document any architectural decisions
- Keep CLAUDE.md updated with new patterns
