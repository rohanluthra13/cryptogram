- Performance monitoring already established with baseline tests
- App performance is excellent (all operations under target thresholds)
- NavigationStack handles transitions efficiently
- Simple puzzle game doesn't require enterprise-level monitoring

**Conclusion**: Phase 5 objectives were largely achieved in Phase 0. Additional testing would provide minimal value for an app of this size and complexity.

## Implementation Strategy

### Feature Flag Rollout Plan
1. **Week 1**: Infrastructure setup
2. **Week 2-3**: Navigation behind `new_navigation` flag
3. **Week 4**: Settings behind `modern_app_settings` flag
4. **Week 5-6**: Services behind `extracted_services` flag
5. **Week 7-10**: Gradual feature flag removal

### Risk Mitigation

**Critical Risks Identified**:
1. **No performance baseline**: Mitigate with Phase 0 benchmarking
2. **Complex navigation state**: Feature flags allow rollback
3. **Memory leak potential**: Add detection in Phase 0
4. **Integration test gaps**: Re-enable before major changes

### Success Metrics (Updated)

**Quantitative**:
- Reduce navigation boolean flags from 8+ to 2
- Fix SwiftUI preview crashes (0 crashes)
- Maintain <2s app launch time
- Reduce HomeView from 400+ lines to <200 lines

**Qualitative**:
- Simplified navigation code
- Reliable SwiftUI previews
- Standard navigation patterns
- Improved debugging experience

## Phase Priority Rationale

1. **Navigation First**: Most complex, user-facing, affects all development
2. **Settings Second**: Blocking preview development, architectural foundation  
3. **Services Third**: Code organization, no user impact
4. **Modern Features**: Polish and future-proofing
5. **Testing/Performance**: Validation and optimization

**Total Estimated Time**: 10 weeks with reduced risk and better measurability

## Phase 0 Results & Lessons Learned

### Achievements
1. **Infrastructure Established**: All safety nets in place for refactoring
2. **Test Coverage Improved**: 22 new test cases for performance and memory
3. **Feature Flag System**: Safe rollout mechanism implemented
4. **Documentation Complete**: Clear baselines and guidelines for future phases

### Key Metrics Captured
- **AppSettings initialization**: ~0.05s (well under 0.1s target)
- **Database initialization**: ~0.3s (under 0.5s target)
- **Puzzle loading**: ~0.15s (under 0.2s target)
- **Memory management**: No retain cycles detected

### Unexpected Findings
1. **AppSettingsTests**: Required updates to match current implementation (no difficultyMode property)
2. **PuzzleViewModelIntegrationTests**: Needs proper DI implementation before re-enabling
